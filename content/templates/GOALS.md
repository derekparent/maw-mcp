# Project Goals

MAW reads this file to prioritize analysis and agent tasks.
Place in repo root as `GOALS.md` or `.maw/goals.md`.

## Active Focus
<!-- Current priorities - MAW will prioritize findings here -->
- Mobile-first redesign of the main screens
- Touch targets too small on inventory page
- Forms need better validation feedback

## Backlog
<!-- Next up - MAW considers these secondary priorities -->
- Add offline sync capability
- Improve error messages throughout
- API response caching

## Not Now
<!-- Explicitly deprioritized - MAW will skip unless critical -->
- Performance optimization (good enough for now)
- Additional API endpoints for reporting
- Dark mode support
